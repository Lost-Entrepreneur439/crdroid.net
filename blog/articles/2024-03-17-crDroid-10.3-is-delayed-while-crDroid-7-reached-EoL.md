# crDroid 10.3 is delayed 

We've got some news for all the crDroid enthusiasts out there.  
The highly anticipated release of crDroid 10.3 is unfortunately facing a bit of a delay.  
The culprit? The merge with Android 14 QPR2.  
We don't have a release date for crDroid 10.3 just yet, but rest assured the team is working hard to iron out these wrinkles.  

# crDroid 7 reaches End of Life

As Android 11 reaches end of life with Googleâ€™s final security patch, so we must also.  
crDroid 7 is our longest maintained Android update to date, with lots of installations still active.  
We understand this might come as disappointing news for some crDroid 7 users.  
The good news is that there are other still supported crDroid revisions ready.  
We recommend transitioning to the latest stable version of crDroid (10), which offers a bunch of improvements, the latest Android features, and most importantly, up-to-date security patches. 

# Device updates

Anyway, this month we have few more devices added to crDroid 10 support list, with few loosing their support unfortunately, so looking for new maintainers.
