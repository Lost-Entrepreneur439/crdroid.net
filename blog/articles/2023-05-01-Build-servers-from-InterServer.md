Hey guys.  
Starting today we have partenered with [InterServer](https://www.interserver.net/r/836686) for our build servers.  
We hope that by doing this, we can deliver faster builds for you all.  
We've been doing builds with their servers for a while now and the fact that we have devices that provide weekly updates is all because of your support and their servers.  
So, if you are interested in all kind of hosting, from website hosting to cheap dedicated bare metal servers, do check it out [here](https://www.interserver.net/r/836686).
