OK so this is a faster one.  
Since our 9.6 release took a while, well normally the 9.7 release that got out as I write, took less :).  
So, the July security patch is out bringing following changes alongside the normal security patches.

| Change |
| --- |
| Initial crDroid 9.7 release |
| Updated to June 2023 security patches (android-13.0.0_r61) |
| Fixed an issue with default clock app not playing alarm when setting increasing ring | 
| Launcher3: Fixing icon cache thrashing due to an unsupported icon |
| Fixed crash in AccountManager after profile removal |
| WallpaperService: Fix half black wallpaper after rotating quickly |
| Fixed Youtube playback in PiP mode |
| Fixed unlink ringtone and notifications volume |
| Fixed screen off fingerprint reader |
| Fixed some issues with parallel space |
| Removed QS footer data usage (causes stutters) |
| Updated Chromium Webview to 114.0.5735.196 |
| Some other fixes here and there |
| Updated translations |

That's it for now.
