### Well it sure has been a while
The team here at crDroid sure isn't sleeping.  
In the last few (lot of) days, we've worked a lot on optimizing our frontend, backend and of course our source.  

What does it mean you ask?  
*Frontend*  
Well first for public area, we've added a blog page on our website where you can check what the team is working on. 
We hope this will be a good way for us to interact with the community more and get some on site feedback for our work.  
*Backend*  
Optimized some stuff for our API.  
*Source*  
Well here Pranav (*neobuddy89*) is doing what he's doing best with updating source with latest security patches and features for Android 12, all while Andrzej (*xNombre*) and Simone (*DarkJoker360*) are optimizing and updating Android backend.
