### Today I'm proud to announce that the first crDroid 8 build is up.

We've worked a lot to make things stable and to have good customisation options ready for this initial release.
For now only Poco X3 Pro got this build with more devices following up soon.

We plan to make this version of crDroid, the best yet and more customisation stuff is going to get added to ROM with each update, so stick close to our releases on our Telegram https://t.me/crDroidUpdates
