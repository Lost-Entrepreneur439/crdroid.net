### Hey there everyone
March has been a tough month for crDroid with the advent to Android 12L based crDroid.

Sure took us a while to bring back all features we already implemented in Android 12, but we did it.
So while there are not many new stuff added, we were sure busy.
One of the things we recently added is reTicker, that replaces heads-up notifications with a more slim and less invasive version so try it out if already landed in your crDroid update.

We've also added support for few more devices:

| Device | Link |
| --- | --- |
| Lenovo ZUK Z2 Plus | <https://crdroid.net/z2_plus/8> |
| POCO M3 & Redmi 9T | <https://crdroid.net/juice/8> |
| Pixel 2 XL | <https://crdroid.net/taimen/8> |

Well, catch y'all next month!
