Heya guys.  

Our current website host, [ScopeHosts](https://scopehosts.com), is moving to some new sever hardware, so starting from 31th May 2023 +5:30 IST 10:30 A.M, there will be some downtime with our site.  
All downloads will still work from our SF page, as well as some limited backend functions.  
During this process, we are expecting to keep the downtime to minimal so bear with us until this operation is done.

Cheers from crDroid Team.
