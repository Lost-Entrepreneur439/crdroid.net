Well after few ALPHA and some BETA builds and ofc with the help of you, our community, we've finally managed to release our 9.6 version of crDroid.  
Hopefully most bugs are ironed out, but if anything slipped through the cracks, we'll for sure fix with upcoming next updates.  
This update took a bit longer since it's a QPR release, meaning we have to re-add features again, one by one, on top of Google AOSP / Lineage code.  
Anyway, below you can find a list of changes we've made since the last update.
