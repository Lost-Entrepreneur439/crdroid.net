# crDroid 10.4 is our fastest update yet (smile?)

Just hours after we released our crDroid 10.3 update, LineageOS that is our main base, merged April security patches.  
So while we were at it, we also did the same.

## What's New?
Well basically, April 2024 security patches, and some last minute changes that didn't reach initial release of crDroid 10.3.  
Our servers are already syncronizing the main source, so expect an update sooner rather than later.
