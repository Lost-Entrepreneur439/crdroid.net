title: crDroid 9.9 released
description: September security patches ready

As with every month, we are now ready with version 9.9 that brings crDroid inline with September security patches.  
Do note that due to missing Google Pixel September updates, we did not update build fingerprint in order to let SafetyNet pass.  
What this means is that in settings you'll see old security patch date (2023-08-05) but rest assured that's only cosmetic change and all security fixes are merged properly.  
If Google releases said patches, we will merge and fix accordingly.
Some other notable changes.
